What is Pod Security Admission?

Pod Security Admission is a built-in Kubernetes security mechanism that controls whether a Pod is allowed to run based on how securely it is configured. When a Pod is created or updated, 
Kubernetes checks the Pod specification against predefined security standards and decides to allow, warn, or block the Pod. This helps prevent insecure workloads, such as Pods running in 
privileged mode, accessing host resources, or running as the root user, from being deployed into the cluster.

Pod Security Admission works at the namespace level and is configured using labels that define the required security level. Kubernetes provides three standard levels: Privileged, which allows 
unrestricted access and is mainly used for system components; Baseline, which blocks clearly dangerous configurations while allowing most common workloads; and Restricted, which enforces strong 
security practices such as running containers as non-root, disabling privilege escalation, and limiting access to the host. These levels can be applied in different modes such as enforce (block non-compliant Pods), 
warn (allow but show warnings), or audit (log violations).

In simple terms, Pod Security Admission acts like a security gate that validates Pod security before it starts running. It replaces the older PodSecurityPolicy feature with a simpler and
more consistent approach, helping teams improve cluster security by stopping unsafe Pods early, without relying on manual reviews or post-deployment fixes.


1. Why should etcd be encrypted?

etcd stores all Kubernetes data, including secrets, configuration, and cluster information. Secrets in Kubernetes are only base64 encoded, not encrypted, so anyone who gets access to etcd files or 
backups can read them. Encrypting etcd protects this data if disks or backups are accessed and helps prevent data leakage.

2. Why is encryption needed when Secrets are already encoded?

Kubernetes Secrets are only base64 encoded, which is easy to decode and does not provide security. Encryption is needed to protect secret data so that even if someone accesses etcd storage or backups, 
they cannot read the actual values without the encryption key.

3. Difference between ConfigMap and Secret

ConfigMaps are used to store non-sensitive configuration data such as environment names or application settings and are stored in plain text. Secrets are used to store sensitive data like passwords and 
tokens and are base64 encoded. Secrets are meant to be protected using RBAC and etcd encryption.

4. What is Pod Security Admission?

Pod Security Admission is a Kubernetes security feature that checks Pod configurations before they run and blocks insecure Pods. It helps prevent risky settings such as running containers as root or 
using privileged mode. It works at the namespace level and enforces predefined security rules.

5. Why use Azure Key Vault when Kubernetes has Secrets?

Azure Key Vault provides stronger security and centralized management for secrets, keys, and certificates. Even when using Key Vault, Kubernetes still stores internal data and references in etcd, so 
etcd encryption is still important. Using Key Vault along with Kubernetes security features is a best practice.

What is Pod Security Admission?

Pod Security Admission is a built-in Kubernetes security mechanism that controls whether a Pod is allowed to run based on how securely it is configured. When a Pod is created or updated, 
Kubernetes checks the Pod specification against predefined security standards and decides to allow, warn, or block the Pod. This helps prevent insecure workloads, such as Pods running in 
privileged mode, accessing host resources, or running as the root user, from being deployed into the cluster.

Pod Security Admission works at the namespace level and is configured using labels that define the required security level. Kubernetes provides three standard levels: Privileged, which allows 
unrestricted access and is mainly used for system components; Baseline, which blocks clearly dangerous configurations while allowing most common workloads; and Restricted, which enforces strong 
security practices such as running containers as non-root, disabling privilege escalation, and limiting access to the host. These levels can be applied in different modes such as enforce (block non-compliant Pods), 
warn (allow but show warnings), or audit (log violations).

In simple terms, Pod Security Admission acts like a security gate that validates Pod security before it starts running. It replaces the older PodSecurityPolicy feature with a simpler and
more consistent approach, helping teams improve cluster security by stopping unsafe Pods early, without relying on manual reviews or post-deployment fixes.
